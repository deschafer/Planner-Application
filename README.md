# Planner-Application
NOTICE -- THIS IS AN OLD UNSUPPORTED VERSION, VISIT https://github.com/deschafer/Plan-IT-V1.0 FOR THE MOST RECENT VERSION

Repository for my planner application.

This planner is the continued version that was stored in the PersonalProjects repository earlier. This is the next version, and it implements a variety of new features including some of the following.

1. Radically redesigned the view architecture. The application now spports mutliple views, weekly and monthly fully working right now, for the same planner object implemented via subtype polymorphism.
  The new subviews are in the ViewBase.h file.
  The daily view is a work in progress at the moment.
2. Dialog to add event to current planner object for two views, weekly and monthly.
3. Better color scheme and appearance.
4. Enhanced controls for Monthly view.
5. Scrolling works for the weekly view.

...

The list goes on for the added features, and this version of the planner looks much more similar to how the final version will appear. That being said, this application is still no where near to being complete, and there are still many more features to add.
